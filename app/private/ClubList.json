Once in Mortar Board, you will engage in various community service and fundraising activities. It is a great opportunity to give back to the community and form close friendships with your fellow Mortar Board members. This honor society is more than just prestige, but rather, an opportunity for every undergraduate senior to make a local impact in their campus and community before they graduate.
